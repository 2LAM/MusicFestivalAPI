# MusicFestivalAPI

*Note: This is only one way of how you can run this application locally. The PHP script can also be deployed on a web server but I found this method very quick and simple.</br></br>

To deploy this application locally:</br>
	+Download XAMPP which is available at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html.</br>
	+After you install XAMPP, navigate to your installed location and go to "/htdocs". E.g. "C:\xampp\htdocs".</br>
	+Drop "MusicFestivalAPI.php" in "/htdocs".</br>
	+Start XAMPP</br>
	+Click "Start" for Apache</br>
	+In your browser, go to localhost/MusicFestivalAPI.php</br>
